.htaccess protect download private files from user's directory using php

My php script create a user's directory to store private files and I need to keep it private except for the owner.

Basically my structure is like this:

- root/
- storage/
---- users/
----------user1/
---------------.htaccess
---------------images/
---------------tmp/
-------------------session-id-file
----------user2/
---------------.htaccess
---------------images/
---------------tmp/
-------------------session-id-file

This means when a new user register then a new user's directory is created in /storage/users:

$dir = __DIR__ . "/storage/user/" . $user["id"]; mkdir($dir);

Then a new .htaccess is created inside:

 $myfile = fopen($file, "w") or die("Unable to create file!");
 $txt = "RewriteCond %{HTTP_COOKIE}        PHPSESSID=(\w+)\n
 **RewriteCond {CURRENT-DIRECTORY}/tmp/access-%1      -f \n**
 RewriteRule ^(.+)$  $1  [L]\n
 RewriteRule .+  /deny   [L]\n";
 fwrite($myfile, $txt);
 fclose($myfile);

The .htaccess appears as:

RewriteCond %{HTTP_COOKIE}        PHPSESSID=(\w+)
RewriteCond {CURRENT-DIRECTORY}/tmp/access-%1      -f
RewriteRule ^(.+)$  $1  [L]

RewriteRule .+  /deny   [L]

When user login a new session-id-file is crerated in user's tmp directory:

touch($dir . "/tmp/" . session_id());

My question is: how detect {current directory} where the htaccess is located ? Basically how fix the wrong line in .htaccess:

        RewriteCond {CURRENT-DIRECTORYY}}/tmp/access-%1      -f \n

I have seen similar question but I'm not able to detect current directory based on directory created on fly.

A good option could be using just one .htaccess into /users directory instead of many .htaccess for each user as I did in my example.

Thanks for any suggestion :)
